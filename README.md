Collapse Launcher is a launcher especially made for Honkai Impact 3rd. This launcher not only provides you a feature to download and launch the game, but also some advanced features that the Official Launcher doesn't have, including:
* Caches Download (or aka. "Updating Settings" in-game).
* Game Data Repair (with less data needed than Data Repair feature in-game).
* Changing Game Settings (like: Graphics Settings and Audio Settings) without opening the game.
* Cutscenes Download and Subtitle Fix feature (Coming Soon).
* Multi-Region Game Download (supporting: Southeast Asia, Global, TW/HK/MO, Mainland China and Korea version).
* Steam to Global version conversion (without re-downloading the whole game).
* Enabling Game Mirror Server to be used for game (Powered by: Hi3Mirror)(Coming Soon).
* Multi-session Download for Game Download/Installation.
* Multi-thread Game Extraction for faster installation.
* Ability to select Graphics API (DirectX 11 (FL: 10.1, 11.0 and 11.1) and DirectX 12 [May crash the game in newer stages]).

This launcher requires [**.NET Core 6 Desktop Runtime**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.3-windows-x64-installer) and [**WinUI 3 (WindowsAppSDK Runtime 1.0)**](https://github.com/neon-nyan/CollapseLauncher/releases/download/CL-v1.0.7-pre/prequesties-20220204.7z) in order to run.

Unfortunately, this launcher only supports x64-bit version of Windows 10 (Build 1809 or later) or Windows 11 (Any Build) due to WinUI 3 limitation. ([**Read More Here**](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/about.html))
 
# Supported Game Client
For now, this tool only supports these versions of the game:
* Southeast Asia
* Global
* TW/HK/MO
* Mainland China
* Korea
 
Any contribution in this project are welcome.
