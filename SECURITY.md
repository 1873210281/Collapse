# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Due to frequent breaking changes from the HoYoverse/Cognosphere regarding game repair indexes, cache files, update zip files, etc. we can only support any latest Collapse version, be it either from Stable or Preview branch.
Additionally, due to major changes that happened on the Collapse, we cannot support any version below 1.69.0 and should be updated ASAP to latest version, either with in-build updater, or by reinstalling Collapse Launcher manually (if the built-in launcher fails to update from such old version of Collapse).
| Version   | Supported          |
| -------   | ------------------ |
| >=1.69.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.69  | :x:                |
